INTRODUCTION

For elderly individuals, especially those who live alone, falls are a terrifying reality. A hospital-based 
study [1] of elderly people in Colombo, Sri Lanka, reported that 23.3% of people over 65 years were 
subjected to falls within a year. Alarmingly, one in five falls results in a major injury that could impair a 
person's mobility and freedom in the long run. Although research shows that itâ€™s possible to prevent or 
lessen many injuries caused by falls, the reality is that falls do and will continue to negatively affect the 
elderly. 
This introducing Fall Detection device can help prevent the worst outcomes from occurring. Victims of 
falls might have been on the ground for several hours before anybody realized they needed assistance. 
This device works by identifying a person's rapid shift in a posture to assist lower the chance of long-term 
harm. Even if the user is unable to ask for assistance directly, the device does so, triggering an immediate 
emergency response to deal with the crisis. Using this device can give families and caregivers an extra 
layer of support and peace of mind when it comes to the safety of their loved ones.
